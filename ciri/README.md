# cIRI

A low level implementation of an IOTA node in C.

This is a WIP [IOTA](https://iota.org/) node. It allows users to become part of the [IOTA](https://iota.org/) network as both a transaction relay and network information provider through the easy-to-use [API](https://iota.readme.io/reference).

## How to get started

The IOTA network is an independent peer-to-peer network with a first-user, friend-to-friend, network structure:

- As a 'first-user' network, to access the data streams and APIs that other users provide, you must first exchange your IP and port configuration with a current user.

- As a 'friend-to-friend' network, you have the privilege of joining new users into the network through your node by adding them to your approved neighbors list â€” ensuring that you both broadcast to them and also receive their broadcasts.

You can find neighbors quickly at both our [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/7Gu2mG5) and [Forum](https://forum.iota.org/).

Everyone will be welcoming and very happy to help you get connected. If you want to get tokens for your testcase, please just ask in one of the communication channels.

## Build and run cIRI

cIRI is built and run through [bazel](https://www.bazel.build/).

Clone the project

```
$ git clone https://github.com/iotaledger/entangled.git
$ cd entangled
```

*First build can take some time due to dependencies downloading.*

### For a mainnet node

Create the databases, only the first time:
```
$ sqlite3 ciri/db/tangle-mainnet.db < common/storage/sql/tangle-schema.sql
$ sqlite3 ciri/db/spent-addresses-mainnet.db < common/storage/sql/spent-addresses-schema.sql
```

Build and run cIRI
```
$ bazel run -c opt --define network=mainnet -- ciri # optional flags
```
### For a testnet node

Create the databases, only the first time:
```
$ sqlite3 ciri/db/tangle-testnet.db < common/storage/sql/tangle-schema.sql
$ sqlite3 ciri/db/spent-addresses-testnet.db < common/storage/sql/spent-addresses-schema.sql
```

Build and run cIRI
```
$ bazel run -c opt --define network=testnet -- ciri # optional flags
```



## Configuration

### Configuration file

cIRI configuration file is a [YAML](http://yaml.org/) file with path `ciri/conf.yml`.

An example file `ciri/conf.example.yml` is provided; you can rename it, uncomment and change values of options you want to use.

Example syntax:

```yaml
log-level: debug
neighbors: "udp://148.148.148.148:14265"
http-port: 14265
```
