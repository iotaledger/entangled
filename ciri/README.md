# cIRI

A low level implementation of an IOTA node in C.

This is a WIP [IOTA](https://iota.org/) node. It allows users to become part of the [IOTA](https://iota.org/) network as both a transaction relay and network information provider through the easy-to-use [API](https://iota.readme.io/reference).

## How to get started

The IOTA network is an independent peer-to-peer network with a first-user, friend-to-friend, network structure:

- As a 'first-user' network, to access the data streams and APIs that other users provide, you must first exchange your IP and port configuration with a current user.

- As a 'friend-to-friend' network, you have the privilege of joining new users into the network through your node by adding them to your approved neighbors list â€” ensuring that you both broadcast to them and also receive their broadcasts.

You can find neighbors quickly at both our [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/7Gu2mG5) and [Forum](https://forum.iota.org/).

Everyone will be welcoming and very happy to help you get connected. If you want to get tokens for your testcase, please just ask in one of the communication channels.

## Build and run cIRI

cIRI is built and run through [bazel](https://www.bazel.build/).

```
$ git clone https://github.com/iotaledger/entangled.git
$ cd entangled
$ bazel run --define network=mainnet|testnet -- ciri <optional flags>
```

*First build can take some time due to dependencies downloading.*

## Configuration

### Configuration file

cIRI configuration file is a [YAML](http://yaml.org/) file with path `ciri/conf.yml`.

Example file:

```yaml
log-level: debug
neighbors: "udp://148.148.148.148:14265"
port: 14265
```

### Command Line Interface

Long option | Short option | Description | Example input
--- | --- | --- | ---
`--db-path` | `-d` | Path to the database file. | `-d ciri/db/ciri-mainnet.db`
`--help` | `-h` | Displays the usage. |
`--log-level` | `-l` | Valid log levels: "debug", "info", "notice", "warning", "error", "critical", "alert" and "emergency". | `-l debug`
`--mwm` | | Number of trailing ternary 0s that must appear at the end of a transaction hash. Difficulty can be described as 3^mwm. | `--mwm 14`
`--neighbors` | `-n` | URIs of neighbouring nodes, separated by a space. | `-n "udp://148.148.148.148:14265 udp://[2001:db8:a0b:12f0::1]:14265"`
`--p-propagate-request` |  | Probability of propagating the request of a transaction to a neighbor node if it can't be found. This should be low since we don't want to propagate non-existing transactions that spam the network. Value must be in [0,1]. | `--p-propagate-request 0.01`
`--p-remove-request` | | Probability of removing a transaction from the request queue without requesting it. Value must be in [0,1]. | `--p-remove-request 0.01`
`--p-reply-random-tip` | | Probability of replying to a random transaction request, even though your node doesn't have anything to request. Value must be in [0,1]. | `--p-reply-random-tip 0.66`
`--p-select-milestone` | | Probability of sending a current milestone request to a neighbour. Value must be in [0,1]. | `--p-select-milestone 0.7`
`--p-send-milestone` | | Probability of sending a milestone transaction when the node looks for a random transaction to send to a neighbor. Value must be in [0,1]. | `--p-send-milestone 0.02`
`--requester-queue-size` | | Size of the transaction requester queue. | `--requester-queue-size 10000`
`--tcp-receiver-port` | `-t` | TCP listen port. | `-t 15600`
`--tips-cache-size` | | Size of the tips cache. Also bounds the number of tips returned by getTips API call. | `--tips-cache-size 5000`
`--udp-receiver-port` | `-u` | UDP listen port. | `-u 14600`
`--max-find-transactions` | | The maximal number of transactions that may be returned by the 'findTransactions' API call. If the number of transactions found exceeds this number an error will be returned | `--max-find-transactions 100000`
`--max-get-trytes` | | Maximum number of transactions that will be returned by the 'getTrytes' API call. | `--max-get-trytes 10000`
`--port` | `-p` | HTTP API listen port. | `--port 14265`
`--alpha` | | Randomness of the tip selection. Value must be in [0, inf] where 0 is most random and inf is most deterministic. | `--alpha 0.001`
`--below-max-depth` | | Maximum number of unconfirmed transactions that may be analysed to find the latest referenced milestone by the currently visited transaction during the random walk. | `--below-max-depth 20000`
`--coordinator` | | The address of the coordinator. | `--coordinator "KPW...BWU"`
`--last-milestone` | | The index of the last milestone issued by the corrdinator before the last snapshot. | `--last-milestone 774804`
`--max-depth` | | Limits how many milestones behind the current one the random walk can start. | `--max-depth 15`
`--num-keys-in-milestone` | | The depth of the Merkle tree which in turn determines the number of leaves (private keys) that the coordinator can use to sign a message. | `--num-keys-in-milestone 20`
`--snapshot-file` | | Path to the file that contains the state of the ledger at the last snapshot. | `--snapshot-file external/snapshot_mainnet/file/snapshot.txt`
`--snapshot-signature-depth` | | Depth of the snapshot signature. | `--snapshot-signature-depth 6`
`--snapshot-signature-file` | | Path to the file that contains a signature for the snapshot file. | `--snapshot-signature-file external/snapshot_sig_mainnet/file/snapshot.sig`
`--snapshot-signature-index` | | Index of the snapshot signature. | `--snapshot-signature-index 9`
`--snapshot-signature-pubkey` | | Public key of the snapshot signature. | `--snapshot-signature-pubkey "TTX...YAC"`
`--snapshot-timestamp` | | Epoch time of the last snapshot | `--snapshot-timestamp 1537203600`
