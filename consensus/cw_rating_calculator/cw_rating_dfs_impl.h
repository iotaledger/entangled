 * This implementation does a DFS from entry point to discover all transactions
 * this first DFS is done using storage to load each transaction approvers, and
 * we use this DFS to store transactions loaded from storage in a map (in

 * approvers using the map we got from initial DFS Complexity: DFS + (num
 * vertices)*DFS = (E+V) + V*(E+V) ~ V*(E+V)~O(V^2)
 *
 * (E ~ 2*V - because each transaction has two outcoming edges)
