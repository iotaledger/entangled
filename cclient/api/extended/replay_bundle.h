/**
 * @brief Reattaches a transfer to the Tangle by selecting tips and performing the Proof-of-Work again.
 *
 * Reattachments are useful in case the original transactions are pending, and can be done securely as many times as
 * needed. This will make a new, but identical transaction which now also can be approved. If any of the replayed
 * transactions gets approved, the others stop getting approved.
 *
 * @param[in] serv client service
 * @param[in] tail_hash Tail transaction hash
 * @param[in] depth The depth for getting transactions to approve
 * @param[in] mwm The Minimum Weight Magnitude for doing Proof-of-Work
 * @param[in] reference Hash of transaction to start random-walk from. Can be <b>Null</b>, in that case the latest
 * milestone is used as a reference.
 * @param[out] bundle Analyzed transaction objects.
